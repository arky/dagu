# Code of Conduct

This project is covered under the [Go Community Code of Conduct](https://golang.org/conduct).

## Summary
This document summarizes the [Go Community Code of Conduct](https://golang.org/conduct), emphasizing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of background. It has three primary goals:

1. **Establish clear behavioral standards:** Define acceptable behavior for respectful communication.

2. **Provide a conflict resolution process:** Offer a mechanism for addressing disagreements within the community.

3. **Promote inclusivity:** Foster a welcoming environment for people from all backgrounds.

The document stresses the importance of respectful communication, even during disagreements. It outlines "Gopher Values," which include being friendly, patient, thoughtful, respectful, charitable, constructive, and responsible. It discourages disrespectful behavior, offensive comments, and microaggressions.

The Code of Conduct itself pledges a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of various personal characteristics. It provides examples of acceptable and unacceptable behaviors, placing responsibility on project maintainers to enforce the code. It applies to both project spaces and public spaces when representing the project.

The document encourages direct communication to resolve conflicts but also provides a reporting mechanism (conduct@golang.org) for unresolved or serious violations. Reports are investigated by Project Stewards and a committee, with the reporter's identity protected. Actions taken can range from no action to permanent expulsion.
